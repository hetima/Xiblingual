# Xiblingual

Xiblingual is plugin for Xcode 5.1 which helps localizing xib/storyboard.
It seems work with 6.1 but not tested enough.

Xiblingual adds item to context menu on Project Navigator.It works when base xib/storyboard or localized xib/storyboard/strings is selected.

Primary xib/storyboard file must be located in `Base.lproj`.

##Features

###Update Localized File
Re-generate localized file from base xib. It keeps localized contents. Both xib and strings are supported.
